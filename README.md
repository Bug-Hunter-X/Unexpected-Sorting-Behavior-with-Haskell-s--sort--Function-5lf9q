This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Haskell when using the `sort` function from `Data.List`.  The `sort` function relies on the default comparison operators for the data type being sorted.  For simple types like integers and strings, this works as expected. However, for more complex types like tuples, the default comparison might not produce the desired ordering.  This example shows how to correctly sort tuples using a custom comparison function.
